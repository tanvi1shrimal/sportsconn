            <p>This User Agreement <strong>(“Agreement”)</strong> contains our terms of service that govern our relationship with users and others who interact with SportsConn, as well as SportsConn brands, products and services, which we call the <strong>“SportsConn Services”</strong> or <strong>“Services”</strong>. By using or accessing the SportsConn Services, you agree to the terms set out in this Agreement, as updated from time to time in accordance with Section 12 below.</p>
            <p>We may from time to time ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply to your interaction with a specific app, product, or service. To the extent those supplemental terms conflict with this Agreement, the supplemental terms associated with the app, product, or service govern with respect to your use of such app, product or service to the extent of the conflict.</p>
            <h3 class="page-header">PRIVACY</h3>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use SportsConn to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information.

This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.</p>
            <p>(b) When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</p>
            <p>(c) When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others have shared with you.  We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information. </p>
            <p>(d) When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of SportsConn, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).</p>
