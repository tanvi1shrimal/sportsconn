            <h3 class="sub-heaher counter">Device information</h3>
            <p>We collect information from or about the computers, phones, or other devices where you install or access our Services, depending on the permissions you’ve granted.

This includes information about the websites and apps you visit, your use of our Services on those websites and apps, as well as information the developer or publisher of the app or website provides to you or us.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-heaher counter">Information from third-party partners</h3>
            <p>We receive information about you and your activities on and off SportsConn from third-party partners, such as information from a partner when we jointly offer services or from an advertiser about your experiences or interactions with them.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-heaher counter">SportsConn companies</h3>
            <p>We receive information about you from companies that are owned or operated by SportsConn, in accordance with their terms and policies.</p>
            <h3 class="page-header">HOW DO WE USE THIS INFORMATION?</h3>
            <p>We are passionate about creating engaging and customized experiences for people. We use all of the information we have to help us provide and support our Services. Here’s how:</p>
            <h3 class="sub-heaher counter">Provide, improve and develop Services</h3>
            <p>(a) We are able to deliver our Services, personalize content, and make suggestions for you by using this information to understand how you use and interact with our Services and the people or things you’re connected to and interested in on and off our Services.</p>
            <p>(b) We also use information we have to provide shortcuts and suggestions to you. For example, we are able to suggest that your friend tag you in a picture by comparing your friend's pictures to information we've put together from your profile pictures and the other photos in which you've been tagged. If this feature is enabled for you, you can control whether we suggest that another user tag you in a photo using the “Tagging” settings. </p>
            <p>(c) When we have location information, we use it to tailor our Services for you and others, like helping you to check-in and find local events or offers in your area or tell your friends that you are nearby.</p>
            <p>(d) We conduct surveys and research, test features in development, and analyze the information we have to evaluate and improve products and services, develop new products or features, and conduct audits and troubleshooting activities.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-heaher counter">Communicate with you</h3>
            <p>We use your information to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Services and let you know about our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-heaher counter">Show and measure ads and services</h3>
            <p>We use the information we have to improve our advertising and measurement systems so we can show you relevant ads on and off our Services and measure the effectiveness and reach of ads and services.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-heaher counter">Promote safety and security</h3>
            <p>(a) We use the information we have to help verify accounts and activity, and to promote safety and security on and off of our Services, such as by investigating suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies. We work hard to protect your account using teams of engineers, automated systems, and advanced technology such as encryption and machine learning. We also offer easy-to-use security tools that add an extra layer of security to your account.</p>
            <p>(b) We use cookies and similar technologies to provide and support our Services and each of the uses outlined and described in this section of our policy.</p>
            <h3 class="page-header">HOW IS THIS INFORMATION SHARED?</h3>
            <h3 class="sub-heaher counter">Sharing on our services</h3>
            <p>People use our Services to connect and share with others. We make this possible by sharing your information in the following ways:</p>
            <strong>People you share and communicate with</strong>
            <p>When you share and communicate using our Services, you choose the audience who can see what you share. For example, when you post on SportsConn, you select the audience for the post, such as a customized group of individuals, all of your Friends, or members of a Group. Likewise, when you use Messenger, you also choose the people you send photos to or message.</p>
            <p>Public information is any information you share with a public audience, as well as information in your Public Profile, or content you share on a SportsConn Page or another public forum. Public information is available to anyone on or off our Services and can be seen or accessed through online search engines, APIs, and offline media, such as on TV.</p>
            <p>In some cases, people you share and communicate with may download or re-share this content with others on and off our Services. When you comment on another person’s post or like their content on SportsConn, that person decides the audience who can see your comment or like. If their audience is public, your comment will also be public.</p>
            <strong>People that see content others share about you</strong>
            <p>Other people may use our Services to share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people may share a photo of you, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you that you shared with them. If you have concerns with someone’s post, social reporting is a way for people to quickly and easily ask for help from someone they trust.</p>
            <strong>Apps, websites and third-party integrations on or using our Services</strong>
            <p>When you use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Services, they may receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your SportsConn friends or use the SportsConn Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website may get information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from their website on SportsConn. In addition, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your Public Profile, which includes your username or user ID, your age range and country/language, your list of friends, as well as any information that you share with them. Information collected by these apps, websites or integrated services is subject to their own terms and policies.</p>
            <strong>Sharing within SportsConn companies</strong>
            <p>We share information we have about you within the family of companies that are part of SportsConn.</p>
            <strong>New owner</strong>
            <p>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Services or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-heaher counter">Sharing with third-party partners and customers</h3>
            <p>We work with third party companies who help us provide and improve our Services or who use advertising or related products, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. Here are the types of third parties we can share information with about you:</p>
            <strong>Advertising, Measurement and Analytics Services (Non-Personally Identifiable Information Only)</strong>
            <p>We want our advertising to be as relevant and interesting as the other information you find on our Services. With this in mind, we use all of the information we have about you to show you relevant ads. We do not share information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable information is information like name or email address that can by itself be used to contact you or identifies who you are) with advertising, measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission. We may provide these partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their advertising without providing information that personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that it does not personally identify you. For example, we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed, or how many people viewed their ads or installed an app after seeing an ad, or provide non-personally identifying demographic information (such as 25 year old male, in London, who likes football and is a left footer) to these partners to help them understand their audience or customers.</p>
            <strong>Vendors, service providers and other partners</strong>
            <p>We transfer information to vendors, service providers, and other partners who globally support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, facilitating payments, or conducting academic research and surveys. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the agreements we enter into with them.</p>            
            <h3 class="sub-heaher counter">How can i manage or delete information about me?</h3>
            <p>(a) You can manage the content and information you share when you use SportsConn through your user profile settings.</p>
            <p>(b) We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others, including those described above. Information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted, unless we no longer need the data to provide products and services.</p>
            <p>(c) You can delete your account any time. When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates. If you do not want to delete your account, but want to temporarily stop using SportsConn, you may deactivate your account instead. Keep in mind that information that others have shared about you is not part of your account and will not be deleted when you delete your account.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-heaher counter">How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</h3>
            <p>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, we may provide information to third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud and abuse on and off of our Services. Information we receive about you, including financial transaction data related to purchases made with SportsConn, may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also may retain information from accounts disabled for violations of our terms for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other violations of our terms.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-heaher counter">How our global services operate?</h3>
            <p>SportsConn may share information internally within our family of companies or with third parties for purposes described in this policy. Information collected within the European Economic Area <strong>(“EEA”)</strong> may, for example, be transferred to countries outside of the EEA for the purposes as described in this policy.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-heaher counter">How will we notify you of changes to this policy?</h3>
            <p>We’ll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to review and comment on the revised policy before continuing to use our Services.</p>
